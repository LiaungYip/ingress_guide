+++

You can hack a portal up to four times in a row. After four hacks, the portal **"burns out"**.

If you try to hack a fifth time, the game will tell you *"Portal burned out! It may take a significant amount of time to re-set."*



## How long does burn-out last?

Burn-out lasts **four hours**.

The four-hour timer starts from your  *first* hack. If you hack four times, starting at 12-o'clock, you can hack again starting at 4-o'clock.

## How can I get more hacks in a row?

Deploying a [heatsink mod](/mods/heat_sink.md) instantly clears the burn-out timer, so you can start hacking again straight away. Heatsinks re-set the burn-out for you, **and only you** - other agents don't benefit. (Details: [Heatsinks](/mods/heat_sink.md)).

Deploying a [multi-hack mod](/mods/multi_hack.md) lets you hack a portal more times in a row, before you burn it out. Multi-hacks benefit all agents - you, your team, and the other team. (Details: [Multi-Hacks](/mods/multi_hack.md)).
