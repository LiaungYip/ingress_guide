Multi-hacks are a kind of [portal mod](../).

**A multi-hack lets you hack a portal more than four times, before the portal burns out.**

Normally you can hack a portal up to four times in a four-hour period. After that, the portal is ["burned out"](mechanics/burnout). You can't hack the portal any more, until the four-hour burnout period passes.

  * No multi-hack: Four hacks before burnout.
  * Common multi-hack (CMH): Extra **four** hacks before burnout.
  * Rare multi-hack (RMH): Extra **eight** hacks before burnout.
  * Very rare multi-hack (VRMH): Extra **twelve** hacks before burnout.

**Multiple multi-hacks:** The best multi-hack gives its full bonus. The second, third, and fourth multi-hack(s) give half of their bonus.

**Durability:** Multi-hacks are fragile. They are easily destroyed by enemy weapons fire.
