Normally a portal "burns out" after four hacks, and you need to wait four hours before you can hack that portal again.

A multi-hack allows you to hack a portal more than four times, before the portal burns out.

Multi-hacks are a kind of [portal mod](#). See [general information about portal mods](#).

**Multiple multi-hacks:** If there is more than one multi-hack on a portal, the best multi-hack gives its full bonus; the other multi-hack(s) give half bonus.

> *Example:* VRMH + VRMH gives 12 + 6 = 18 bonus hacks.
  
**Durability:** Multi-hacks are fragile. They are easily destroyed by enemy weapons fire.
