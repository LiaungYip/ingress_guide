Mods come in different qualities - Common, Rare and Very Rare.

* **Common** mods are coloured green. They are easy to get! Use them when-ever you want.

* **Rare** mods are coloured purple. Use these on portals you care about. Don't worry about wasting them - they aren't actually that rare.

* **Very Rare** mods are coloured pink. They are hard to get! Only deploy these when you can make good use of them. Keep them in a MUFG capsule, which gives you more of them for free.

* **Very, very rare**: The special "AXA Shield" and "Softbank Ultra Link Amp" are even better than "Very Rare" items. Always keep these in a MUFG capsule, so you get more of them for free.
