You have to get within 40 metres of a portal to deploy mods - the same distance as hacking or deploying resonators.

Each portal has **four** mod slots.

You can fill **two** mod slots. You can't fill all four slots yourself! You need team-mates to fill the other slots.

**No take-backs:** You can't remove mods; nor can you upgrade existing mods. Once you put a mod on a portal, it will stay until the enemy team knocks it off! See: [Destroying Mods]({{< ref "mods/destroying.md" >}}).
