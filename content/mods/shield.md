Shields block damage from enemy weapons.

Shields are a kind of [portal mod](#). See [general information about portal mods](#).

----

## Types of shield

* Common Shield (`CS`)
	* **30%** damage blocked
	* Low durability
* Rare Shield (`RS`)
	* **40%** damage blocked
	* Low durability
* Very Rare Shield (`VRS`)
	* **60%** damage blocked

## Damage blocking

**Multiple shields:** Multiple shields **add together**.

> *Example:* two common shields: 30% + 30% = 60% damage blocking.

**Link shielding:** Each link on a portal blocks roughly 10% damage, to a maximum of 50%, with diminishing returns per link. [More details on link shielding.](#)

**95% cap:** The maximum damage blocking is 95%. So enemy weapons will always do at least 5% damage.

## Destroying shields

You destroy shields by [firing weapons](#) at the portal.

Like all [portal mods](#), shield destruction is based on "coin flips". Mods do not have "health bars". Each hit either destroys the mod entirely, or leaves it completely intact.

You can improve your odds on the "coin flip" by:

* Firing from close to the portal centre - ideally on top of it.
* Holding down the fire button to boost your attack (max 20%). [More details on long-press actions.](#)
* Using "Ultra Strike" weapons. [More details on Ultra Strikes.](#)
* Using higher-level weapons.
