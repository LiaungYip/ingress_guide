There are six kinds of portal mod.

* Defensive mods make it harder for enemy players to kill your portals.
    * [Shields](/mods/shield.md) reduce damage from enemy attacks.
    * [Force Amps](/mods/force_amp.md) make portal counter-attacks twice as strong.
    * [Turrets](/mods/turret.md) used to make portal counter-attacks stronger. They don't do much any more.

* Hack mods help you get more items from a portal.
    * [Heatsinks](/mods/heat_sink.md) reduce how long you have to wait between portal hacks.
    * [Multi-hacks](/mods/multi_hack.md) let you hack a portal more than four times in a four-hour period.

* [Link Amps](/mods/link_amp.md) extend linking range, so you can link to portals that are further away.
