There are six kinds of portal mod.

* Defensive mods make it harder for enemy players to kill your portals.
    * [Shields]({{< ref "mods/shield.md" >}}) reduce damage from enemy attacks.
    * [Force Amps]({{< ref "mods/force_amp.md" >}}) make portal counter-attacks twice as strong.
    * [Turrets]({{< ref "mods/turret.md" >}}) used to make portal counter-attacks stronger. They don't do much any more.

* Hack mods help you get more items from a portal.
    * [Heatsinks]({{< ref "mods/heatsink.md" >}}) reduce how long you have to wait between portal hacks.
    * [Multi-hacks]({{< ref "mods/multi_hack.md" >}}) let you hack a portal more than four times in a four-hour period.

* [Link Amps]({{< ref "mods/link_amp.md" >}}) extend linking range, so you can link to portals that are further away.
