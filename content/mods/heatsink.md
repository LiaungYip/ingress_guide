Heatsinks are a kind of [portal mod]({{< ref "mods/index.md" >}}).

Heatsinks make portals "cool down" faster, **so you don't have to wait as long between hacks.**

  * No heatsink: portal cool-down takes five minutes. 5:00 between hacks.
  * Common heatsink (CHS): cool-down is **20% faster**. 4:00 between hacks.
  * Rare heatsink (RHS): cool-down is **50% faster**. 2:30 between hacks.
  * Very Rare heatsink (VRHS): cool-down is **70% faster**. 1:30 between hacks.

**All players benefit** from the shorter cool-down time - you, your team, and the enemy team.

Deploying a heatsink also gives you, **and only you**, the following bonuses:

  * Resets the [portal cool-down timer]({{< ref "hacking/cooldown.md" >}}) - so *you* can hack again immediately.
  * Resets the [portal burn-out timer]({{< ref "hacking/burnout.md" >}}) - so *you* can keep hacking a portal after you burn it out. (See also: the [Multi-hack mod]({{< ref "mods/multi_hack.md">}}).)


**Multiple heat-sinks:** The best heat-sink gives its full bonus. The second, third, and fourth heat-sink(s) only give 1/5th bonus.

**Durability:** Heat-sinks are fragile. They are easily [destroyed by enemy weapons fire]({{< ref "mods/destroying.md" >}}).
