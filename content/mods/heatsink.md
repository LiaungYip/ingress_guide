Normally, you have to wait five minutes between each time you hack a portal.

A heat-sink does two things:

1. Reduces the five-minute cool-down period, so you don't have to wait as long between hacks.
2. Immediately re-sets your cool-down timer and burn-out timer. (See details below.)

Heat-sinks are a kind of [portal mod](#). See [general information about portal mods](#).

## Types of heat sink

* No heat sink
  * 300 seconds (5:00) between hacks.
* Common Heat Sink (`CHS`)
  * Cooldown time is reduced by **20%**. 240 seconds (4:00) between hacks.
* Rare Heat Sink (`RHS`)
  * Cooldown time is reduced by **50%**. 150 seconds (2:30) between hacks.
* Very Rare Heat Sink (`VRHS`)
  * Cooldown time is reduced by **70%**. 90 seconds (1:30) between hacks.

**Multiple heat-sinks:** If there is more than one heat-sink on a portal, the best heat-sink gives its full % bonus; the other heat-sink(s) give half % bonus.

**Durability:** Heat-sinks are fragile. They are easily destroyed by enemy weapons fire.

## Reset cool-down and burn-out timer

Deploying a heat-sink has the following benefits, for **you only**. (Other agents do not benefit.)

1. **Cool-down timer** is instantly re-set.

    So you can hack, apply a heat-sink, and hack immediately without waiting the usual time.
    
2. **Burn-out timer** is instantly re-set.

    So you can hack a portal until it is burned out, apply a heat-sink, then continue hacking the portal. This bypasses the usual four-hour burn out timer.
