You destroy mods on enemy portals by firing weapons at the portal.

Portal mods don't have their own "life bar". Each weapon hit either destroys the mod entirely, or leaves the mod completely intact.

**In other words, mod destruction is based on "coin flips", not "damage".**

You can improve your odds on the "coin flip" to destroy a mod, by doing the following:

  * Long-press the "FIRE" button to get an attack bonus - up to 20%.
  * Stand closer to the portal's centre - ideally, *right on top* of the portal!
  * Use the special "ultra-strike" weapons. Ultra-strikes hit very hard in a *small area*. Even level 1 ultra-strikes are good!
  * Use higher-level weapons. Level 8 XMPs work better than Level 1 XMPs.

**Shield mods are harder to destroy than other mods.** Very Rare Shields and AXA Shields are very hard to destroy! Use the above "tricks" to efficiently destroy shields.

Portal mods can pop off quickly, if you are lucky. Other times, portal mods won't pop off, despite your best efforts. Don't be discouraged! **Follow the advice above and you will destroy the mods eventually.**
